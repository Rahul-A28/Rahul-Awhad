	<p>4. Create a JS program to implement below:-<br>
 BankAccount<br>
|(accountNumber)<br>
|(accountHolderName)<br>
|(accountBalance)<br>
-------------------------<br>
<pre>|                   |</pre>
<pre>Savings              Current</pre>
 <pre>(isSalary)           (odLimit)</pre><br>
Now,
create 1 object of savings with accountNumber, accountHolderName, accountBalance and isSalary.
create 1 object of currrent with accountNumber, accountHolderName, accountBalance and odLimit.
use savings account object to call a function withdraw(amount), that will subtract the amount from the
accountBalance, Note that accountBalance should not go below 0.
use current account object to calla function withdraw(amount), that will subtract the amount from the
accountBalance, Note that accountBalance should not go below negative of odLimit.
Now, call getCurrentBalance() from both the object, that will return the accountBalance of the object
used to call this method.</p>
<hr>
<p>Look in console for output</p>
