	<p>3. Assuming that the Rectangle constructor takes a width and a height, why does the following output
20 instead of 200? (Hint: if you see an answer that seems too obvious to be what I am looking for,
it probably is the answer I am looking for.)<br>
Rectangle r = new Rectangle(4, 5);<br>
r.hieght = 50;<br>
r.getArea(); --> 20 // Not 200<br></p>
<hr>
<p>Look in console for output</p>
<p>Answer: Since the spelling of height is mis-spelled while assigning new value 50, a new object field is created as 'hieght':50. But while getting the area we get the multiplication of height and width which is 20.</p>
<script type="text/javascript">
	
	var Rectangle = function (width,height){
		this.width = width;
		this.height = height;
	}

	Rectangle.prototype.getArea = function(){
		return this.width*this.height;
	}

	var r = new Rectangle(4,5);
	r.hieght = 50;
	console.log("Area: " + r.getArea());
	console.log(r);
