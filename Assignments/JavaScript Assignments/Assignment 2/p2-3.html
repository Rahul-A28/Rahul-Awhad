	<p>3. JavaScript lets you define anonymous functions and call them right on the spot. For example,
(function(x) { return x*x; })(5) returns 25. Also, if you concatenate a string with a function, the
result is a string that looks more or less like the function definition. For example:<br>
function square(x) { return x*x; }<br>
"square is " + square<br>
--> "square is function square(x) { return x * x; }"<br>
Use these ideas to make an anonymous function call that outputs a string, where inside that string is
exactly what was typed in as the function call. I.e., you go to the Firebug console and type in<br>
(function(...) {something})(blah)<br>
and get back<br>
"(function(...) {something})(blah)"<br>
The return value should be exactly what you typed in, except that it has quotes around it, and it is
OK if the whitespace (spaces, carriage returns) in the return value is not exactly the same as in the
input. To make it even harder, you are not allowed to use arguments.callee or the arguments array at
all. It can be done with “function”, “return”, a variable name, parens, curly braces, and double
quotes: no obscure JavaScript feature (or anything else at all!) is needed. The answer is short, but
this is a very tricky problem.<br> </p>
