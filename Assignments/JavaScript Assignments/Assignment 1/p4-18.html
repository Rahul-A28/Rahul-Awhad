	<p>18) Write a function on_all that applies a function to every element of a list. Use
it to print the first twenty perfect squares. The perfect squares can be found
by multiplying each natural number with itself. The first few perfect squares
are 1*1= 1, 2*2=4, 3*3=9, 4*4=16. Twelve for example is not a perfect
square because there is no natural number m so that m*m=12. (This
question is tricky if your programming language makes it difficult to pass
functions as arguments.)
