	<p>17. Given an array with numbers, write a program that efficiently answers queries of the form "which is the nearest larger value for the number at position i", where the distance is the difference in array indices. For example in the array [1,4,3,2,5,7], the nearest larger
value for 4 is 5. After linear time preprocessing you should be able to answer queries in
constant time.
