	<p>6. Create a string that contains what looks like an object with firstName and lastName properties. Use
“eval” to turn it into a real object, and test it the same way you did with the previous object that you
created directly.</p>
<hr>
<p>Look in console for output</p>

<script type="text/javascript">
	
	var str = {firstName:"abc",lastName:"xyz"};
	var n = eval("str");
	console.log(n);
	console.log("Middle name: " + n.middleName);
	n.middleName = "midd";
	console.log("After assigning middle name:");
	console.log("Middle name: " + n.middleName);
	console.log(typeof(n));
