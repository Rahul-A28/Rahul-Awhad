	<p>4. Make a variable whose value is an object with firstName and lastName properties, but donâ€™t define
a Person class first. Try looking up the first and last names. Try changing the last name. It seems
very odd to Java programmers to make an object without first defining a class, but JavaScript programmers do this sort of thing all the time.</p>

<p>Look in console for output</p>
<script type="text/javascript">
	
	var n = {firstName:"abc",lastName:"xyz"};
	console.log("First name: " + n.firstName + ", Last name:"+ n.lastName);
	n.lastName = "def";
	console.log("After Changing the last name:");
	console.log("First name: " + n.firstName + ", Last name:"+ n.lastName);
